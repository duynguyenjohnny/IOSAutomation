    "content": "Unit works ok most of the time. Will NOT set the correct time/day automatically and there is no manual method. Thinks it is Jan,9, 1970. Pretty bad for a high end router. Speed is ok but still stumbles sometimes when pushing a lot of video. Looking for a replacement that has a little more control in the setup/configuration since this just leaves me thinking there are other problems that aren't known because the manufacturer is hiding them. I'm a long time NetGear user but this maybe my last one.",
