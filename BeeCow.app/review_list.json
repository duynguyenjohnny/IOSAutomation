    "content": "Unit works ok most of the time. Will NOT set the correct time/day automatically and there is no manual method. Thinks it is Jan,9, 1970. Pretty bad for a high end router. Speed is ok but still stumbles sometimes when pushing a lot of video. Looking for a replacement that has a little more control in the setup/configuration since this just leaves me thinking there are other problems that aren't known because the manufacturer is hiding them. I'm a long time NetGear user but this maybe my last one.",

We finally hired a person to come and get it installed, but he couldn't get it to work either. I regret not fixing it earlier, but circumstances got in the way. We are now stuck with a product that doesn't work and out the money we paid for it. Buyer beware:(",

The most that we use at once is maybe the Netflix or game streaming, our phones, and our laptops at once, but we've had NO problems with speed or connection. Cox set up our nighthawk for us and he even complimented the simplicity of using Netgear products and showed us quickly how he did it. I would definitely recommend buying this Modem/router! WAY better then renting one from Cox for $9.99/mo when this pays for itself in one year and it WAY better quality according to the person who installed our cable/internet!",
